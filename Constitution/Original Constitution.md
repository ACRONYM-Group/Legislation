 The Constitution of Nerdiness

	We are founded upon the idea that a nerd with expertise in but one subject will fail to see the world with the same clarity that a group with many interests can, and together we can think of and perfect ideas through teamwork, and differing proficiencies.

Article 1

Article 1 Section 1
	
	A meeting of A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. is held at least once a month or when a member of the council of Nomes calls one. Each meeting is labeled by the meeting number and the session number. A new session marks an election for president. The president cannot veto an impeachment.

Article 1 Section 2

	The election for president begins with first nominations for people to the council of Nomes, there is then an election for the three members of the council. Then out of those three we elect a president.

	The president has the power to call a meeting (as the rest of the council of Nomes) and to veto anything voted for. The president can resign at any time and the next meeting will be an election. A president can be impeached by a vote of the other two council members and the nymphs. The next meeting will therefore be an election and mark a new session.


Article 1 Section 3
	
	When a project to be developed is suggested to the council the member it is suggested to decides if a meeting shall be called or if it should be reserved for the next meeting. At said meeting there is an election of the Nomes and Nymphs if there is a majority then the Nomes vote on it if it is voted for and not vetoed it is regarded as a new project and is put under control of the suggestor.

	Once a project is fully developed it goes through the same process to be put into action or stored as a theory.

Article 2

Article 2 Section 1
	

	To add a new member to A.C.R.O.N.Y.M there must be a â…” majority of the Nymphs and then a unanimous vote of the Nomes.  If this vote is passed, then the member is added to the nymphery


Article 2 Section 2
	
	An application to speak in front of the acronym group must not be negated by race, gender, ethnicity, or age. If we accept a female to the group we will change the acronym of A.C.R.O.N.Y.M to A Corrupt Regimen Of Nerdy Young Mammals.
