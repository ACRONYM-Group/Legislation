 # The Constitution of Nerdiness

	We are founded upon the idea that a nerd with expertise in but one subject will fail to see the world with the same clarity that a group with many interests can, and together we can conceive of and perfect ideas through teamwork, and differing proficiencies.

# Article 1; Meetings
## Article 1 Section 1; When
A meeting of A.C.R.O.N.Y.M. is held at least once a month tentatively scheduled for the second Saturday of every month, or when a member of the council of Nomes calls one. A lack of a quorum of at least half of the Nymphs and two of the Nomes prevents official action from being taken at a meeting. Each meeting is labeled by the meeting number and the session number. Sessions start on the second Saturday of July, starting with Session 0 starting on July 16th 2016. A new session marks an election for president.

## Article 1 Section 2; What
Elections for the next President of ACRONYM will occur on the first meeting of a session or the first meeting held with a quorum of at least half of the voting body present. The election will start with a vote of all members of ACRONYM via rank choice voting. The top three candidates are selected as the members of the Council of Nomes. If there is a tie which results in there not being a clear top three, those who would be in the Council and those involved in the tie will be put on a runoff ballot to determine the top three. 

Once the Council of Nomes has been selected there is a second rank choice vote among the members of the Council of Nomes, the top candidate in this vote will be the President of ACRONYM for the next Session.

### Article 1 Section 2 Subsection 1; Vote Counting
Counting of votes cast in a rank choice system will be done by finding the maximum rank labeled on a ballot, adding one to this value results in the number of tallies allocated to the candidate ranked first by each voter. If a voter elected to only vote for one candidate it is assumed that this vote is a first rank vote. The second rank will be given the tally count of first rank minus one, and so on to find the score for every subsequent rank.

### Article 1 Section 2 Subsection 2; Supervision
The counting of the votes for any element of the election of the President of ACRONYM requires there be one member of the Nymphery and one Nome to each separately count the ballots. If there is a disagreement regarding the final count, two other members will be delegated to perform a recount.

## Article 1 Section 3; Who
To add a new member to A.C.R.O.N.Y.M there must be a ⅔ majority of the Nymphs and then a unanimous vote of the Nomes. If this vote is passed, then the member is added to the nymphery.

### Article 1 Section 3 Subsection 1
An application to speak in front of the ACRONYM group must not be negated by race, gender, ethnicity, or age. If we accept a female to the group we will change the acronym of A.C.R.O.N.Y.M to A Corrupt Regimen Of Nerdy Young Mammals.
