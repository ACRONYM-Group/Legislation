# COMMITTEE ELECTION SOFTWARE
**AUTHOR:** `ETHAN HUNT`

**DATE:** `11/18/24`

## PROPOSITION IN COUNCIL
The following is proposed to the Council of Nomes. If the council decides so, the following committee shall be spun up and all responsibilities divulged.

### PREAMBLE
**By the power vested in my presidential administration under Article 2 Section 1 Subsection 3 of The running Constitution of Nerdiness I hereby spin up Committee Election Software.**

In preperation for the next Acronym Election, I think it is finally time to write some software to conduct ACRONYM elections electronically.

I am going to **schedule the election for** `January 1st of 2025`, so that the deadline for this project will be a few days before that.

### COMMITTEE MEMBERS
The initial members of Committee Election Software are:

`Ethan`

`Jordan`

`Ash`

### ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION
We need to write client and server software that will run on a virtual machine that ideally someone that isn't me is responsible for.

To start we need to register passwords for each Nymphs on the server, and send these passwords out to all Nymphs on Discord.

Next, Nymphs will need to download a copy of the election client, which they will start by entering their password into.

Their client will connect to the server with the password, and use the password to authenticate a connection to the server.

Using the authenticated connection with the server, the client will work with the server to setup an anonymous key pair with a ring signature protocol, or something else.

The Nymph will then fill out a ballot on the client, and all clients will anonymously send their ballots to the main server at a designated time.

The server will take the ballots, and determine the winner.

### EXPECTED COMMITTEE REPORT FORMAT
Installation of the server software on a machine that isn't in my control ideally.

An announcement allowing Nymphs to download the election client and the source code for the entire server and the clients.

### EXPECTED COMPLETION DATE
The expected completion date for this committee's assigned duties is `12/27/24`.
