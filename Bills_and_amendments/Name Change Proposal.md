PROPOSITION IN COUNCIL:
	
	Inclusivity and openness has always been an integral part of ACRONYM. When the original name was decided upon, we had not considered the long term implications of its phrasing. Over time it has become increasingly clear that our current name undermines the organization's ideals. While technically a correct description at the time, its overly specific nature does not support the diversity we would like to foster within ACRONYM.

	Several members of the Nymphery have expressed their support for changing the name of ACRONYM, to something more fitting. Therefore, the Council of Nomes should elect to use the powers granted in Article 1 Section 3 Subsection 1 of the ACRONYM constitution to officially change the name of ACRONYM to A Clever Regiment of Nerdy Young Mammals. In addition, the language that presents this power should be removed from the constitution, as it will no longer be relevant.

	While this name has a great deal of history within our organization, our name is often among the first impressions prospective members are given. In addition, a name should reflect something of the people who identify with it. As such, itâ€™s important that we choose a name that is compatible with our goals and ideals.

Thank you for your time and consideration,
Jordan Hofstrand, Nome on the ACRONYM Council
Carter Plasek, Nymph and Scribe of ACRONYM
